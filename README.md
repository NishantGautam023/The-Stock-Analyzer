#  The-Stock-Analyzer 📈🤖

Welcome to **The-Stock-Analyzer**, an experimental project inspired by my frustration with checking Wealthsimple stock market updates and whether should i buy on the dip or not. I have been using wealthsimple for more than a year, I decided to build a functional stock assistant that retrieves, analyzes, and creates visualizations of stock market data powered by GPT and driven by effective prompting techniques.

🚧 Warning: This project is still in development. As I learn and build, there will be dragons. Proceed with caution. 🐉
